# Decision Making with Statistics
One of the  reasons statistics is important in decision-making is it can help us see the future. Though all forecasting efforts are subject to certain limitations, predictive analytics has proven to be a helpful way for decision-makers to arrive at truly informed assumptions about future events and trends.

In this project I have used several statistical methods such as hypothesis testing, ANOVA and chi-square to arrive at business conclusions by summerizing total of 7 statistical tests. It also covers simulation of CLT (Central Limit Theory).

## About data
WORLD LIFE EXPECTANCY AND IT'S DEPENDENT FACTORS

The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries.

The data-set related to life expectancy, health factors for 193 countries has been collected from the same WHO data repository website. Among all categories of health-related factors only those critical factors were chosen which are more representative.

It has been observed that in the past 15 years , there has been a huge development in health sector resulting in improvement of human mortality rates especially in the developing nations in comparison to the past 30 years. Therefore, in this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis. The result indicated that most of the missing data was for population, Hepatitis B and GDP. The missing data were from less known countries like Vanuatu, Tonga, Togo, Cabo Verde etc.

## Preliminary steps taken
1. Missing value imputation
2. Outlier analysis
3. Bivariate analysis
4. Trend analysis

## Hypothesis tests used
1. Left-tailed and right-tailed hypothesis testing
2. Two-tailed hypothesis testing
3. Post-hoc test
4. Shapiro test to check normality
5. Levene test to check equivalance of varience
6. Mann Whitney-u for non-parametric test
7. ANOVA
8. Chi-square

## Conclusion
-> The half of the population has life expectancy less than 71 years.

-> Life expectancy for developed countries and developing countries is different.

-> Top 5 developed countries life expectancy is different.

-> Population depends on the year but not on the status of the country.

-> Total expenditure in developed countries is more as compared to developing countries.

-> The proportion of Hepatitis-B immunization in developed countries and developing countries is same.

-> The alcohol level consumption rate is not dependent on country status.
